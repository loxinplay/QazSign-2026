QazSign Mobile Application — Functional Description
Application Overview

QazSign is a mobile application designed to support learning, searching, and translating Kazakh Sign Language (KSL).
The app serves as the main user interface of the project and is built to be simple, accessible, and scalable for future integrations.

The application focuses on:

a Kazakh Sign Language dictionary

search and learning tools

a camera-based translation interface

clear visual separation between gesture input and text output
